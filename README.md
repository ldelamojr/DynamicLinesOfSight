# DynamicLinesOfSight - Given two objects moving in 2D-space at constant, yet not necessarily equal speeds, and whose x and y coordinates are each parameterized with time, plot the lines of sight connecting the two objects at some desired frequency. The goal being to examine the intersections of 'consecutive' lines of sight, eventually focusing on the curve created by connecting the intersections. Are the curves familiar math functions? Are they exotic and not representible by usual math functions?
